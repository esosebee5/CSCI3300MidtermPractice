# MidtermPractice
Mock Midterm App w/ DB Connection

Major Steps:


for the db:
For this app, we only needed 1 table.
- the number of columns is 1 more than the number of input fields
    - that way you can have a column with an auto-incrementing id
- basically each of the columns that receive user input can be type VARCHAR
- you'll want the ID column to be an INT
-> make sure to add the mysqlconnector.jar to the project's dependencies
